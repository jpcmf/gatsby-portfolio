# Privacy Policy

I use Google Analytics as third party tracking service on Gatsby Course website, but I donâ€™t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information.

I use Google Analytics to collect information about how my website performs and how my users, in general, navigate through and use my website. Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your usage of my website.

This data helps me evaluate my users' use; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve my content and website performance.

I do not link or sell any information related to your personal information such as your user name.
