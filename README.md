# Portfolio 2019

This project was generated with [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/#use-the-gatsby-cli).
The main idea is to create a portfolio with Gatsby based on the online course I've done.

## Build Setup

The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run locally.

## Install dependencies

Run `npm install`to install all dependecies of the project in your folder.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `/public` directory.

## Deploy Stuff

Every merge within `master` branch will deploy a new website version - no need to commit `/public/` folder.
This site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - the `/public/` folder is generated automatically on each push.
